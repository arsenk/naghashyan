## How to start project

- Pull the repository
- run this command `./vendor/bin/sail up`
- run migrations `php artisan migrate`


I didn't create filter functionality
I didn't add functionality for adding multiple images
But for images I think we must have separate table, with product_id forein key, to have multiple images for same product


after installing project, register as an admin
after that in dashboard page can see 2 links, Category and Product
